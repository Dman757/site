# iPad Smart Keyboard: French Accents/Ligatures

The following is the results of both blind googling and brute forcing the keyboard space. If this is incomplete, please let me know so that can be fixed.

| Accent/Ligature | How to type | Example |
| :-------------- | :---------- | :------ |
| é (forward facing accent on vowel) | Alt-e | entrée |
| è (backward facing accent on vowel) | Alt-` | fières |
| ï (two dots above a vowel) | Alt-u | naïve |
| ç (cedelia) | Alt-c | français |
| œ (oe ligature) | Alt-q | œuf |
| û (circumflex) | Alt-i | hôtel |

You can also type a forward facing accent on most arbitrary characters by typing it and then pressing Alt-Shift-e. Circumflêxes can be done postfix with Alt-Shift-i too. Thís dóesńt work on every letter, unfortunately. However it does work for enough of them. Not enough for Esperanto's `ĉu` however.
